winjq
=====
Light-weight, jQuery-like interface to the WinJS library (use jQuery in Windows 8 apps). Facade to WinJS using jQuery's familiar interface, plugins available for specific UI functionality.

why
=====
No reason to reimplement items already defined in WinJS, I wrap the WinJS calls in jQuery-like methods.

notes
=====
'jQuery' isn't available, only '$'
